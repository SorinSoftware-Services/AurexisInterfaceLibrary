#### This library is based on the **Luna Interface Suite** by *Nebula Softworks* and has been rebuilt and extended by **SorinSoftware Services** — offering a modern, fast, and visually refined UI experience.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project is based on the <b>Luna Interface Suite</b> by <b>Nebula Softworks</b>, which was discontinued in April 2025.  
> SorinInterfaceUI continues the project as an open-source and freely available successor.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you encounter any issues or bugs, feel free to contact us at [info@sorinservice.online](mailto:info@sorinservice.online).
 

The main goal of this rebuilt library is to **modularize and simplify** the entire codebase —  
making it easier to modify, enhance, and extend with new features.  

_Last updated: October 2025 for AurexisInterfaceUI Beta 0.3_
